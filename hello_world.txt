The sun sets low, the sky ablaze,
In hues of gold and crimson rays.
The world grows quiet, night descends,
A peaceful calm, as daylight ends.

Stars emerge, a twinkling light,
Guiding dreams throughout the night.
The moon above, a silver glow,
Watches over all below.

In this moment, time stands still,
A gentle breeze, a whispering thrill.
Nature's beauty, pure and grand,
A timeless wonder, hand in hand.
